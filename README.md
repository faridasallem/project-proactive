Detecting and Analyzing the Zeus Banking Trojan
Objective
This project focuses on detecting and analyzing the Zeus Banking Trojan using various tools and techniques. The analysis includes malware simulation, network monitoring, memory analysis, and signature-based detection.
________________________________________
Prerequisites
•	Virtual Machine: Install and set up a VM (e.g., VirtualBox or VMware) with an isolated network environment.
•	Operating System: Ensure the VM uses an operating system compatible with the Zeus Trojan binary (e.g., Windows).
•	Tools Required: 
o	Suricata
o	Splunk
o	Volatility Framework
o	YARA
o	theZoo repository: Zeus Banking Trojan Binary
Note: Ensure strict isolation for the malware environment to avoid unintentional infections.

Steps to Implement
1. Simulate Malware Execution
•	Set up a VM and download the Zeus Banking Trojan from theZoo repository.
•	Execute the malware in a controlled environment.
2. Configure Suricata for Network Monitoring
•	Install Suricata on the host machine or within the VM.
•	Monitor network traffic using Suricata's default rules to detect common threats.
•	Write custom Suricata rules for Zeus-specific patterns (e.g., Command and Control (C2) communication).
•	Forward Suricata alerts to Splunk for centralized log analysis.




3. Integrate with Splunk
•	Ingest logs from Suricata and the VM system logs into Splunk.
•	Create correlation rules in Splunk to: 
o	Detect abnormal outbound traffic.
o	Link network anomalies with system activities, such as file system changes or process creation.
•	Build visual dashboards in Splunk to monitor malicious activities.
4. Analyze Memory with Volatility
•	Capture a memory dump from the infected VM.
•	Use Volatility Framework to: 
o	Identify active and injected processes related to Zeus.
o	Analyze Zeus-specific network connections.
5. Detect Zeus with YARA Signatures
•	Write custom YARA rules to detect Zeus-related patterns in binaries, configuration files, and memory dumps.
•	Scan the infected system and memory dumps using YARA to identify Zeus artifacts.
________________________________________
Important Notes
•	Malware Safety: Execute the Zeus Trojan only within a controlled and isolated environment. Ensure it does not affect the host system or other networked devices.
•	Legal Compliance: Ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding malware analysis and usage.

4. Suricata Installation
Prerequisites:
•	Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit).
•	WinPcap or npcap (network packet capture libraries).
Installation Steps:
1.	Download Suricata:
o	Visit the Suricata Downloads page and download the Windows installer.
2.	Install Suricata:
